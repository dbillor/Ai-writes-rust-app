## Assistant's Contribution

The Rust application in this repository was developed by an AI Assistant. The Assistant was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing the application, as well as pushing it to the GitHub repository. Here is a summary of the steps taken by the Assistant:

1. Analyzed the user's requirements and designed the application architecture, including modules for log parsing, data structures, logging, unit testing, and a command-line interface.
2. Implemented the application in Rust, adhering to best practices for safety, performance, and maintainability.
3. Wrote unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code and prevent regressions.
4. Tested the application to ensure it meets the user's requirements.
5. Pushed the completed application to the GitHub repository.

This demonstrates the AI Assistant's capability to develop a complete Rust application and showcase it on a public platform.
